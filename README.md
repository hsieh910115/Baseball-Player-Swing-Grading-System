We use Aron Judge and Shohei Ohtani to be our swing standard, we can choose position 1~9 to compare with their swing mechanics, such as body angle... , and final we will get a score and short comment.

1.Prepare your swing video input.mp4

2.Run VideoPose3D.ipynb to create three folders: detectron2, VideoPose3D, videos, and you'll get output.mp4

3.Run grade.py to generate the grade.png
